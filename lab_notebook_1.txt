IMPORTANT: NEW DATA TO BE STORED ARE NORMALLY AVERAGED WITH EXISTING DATA. It is often necessary to remove existing data by clicking on the ZERO ALL DATA button, , or the File/Zero menu item before beginning a data acquisition sweep.

When numerical values are to be entered in the process of system and channel configuration, expressions can usually be entered and the values automatically calculated

issues with power suply. constant voltage Vs constant current.

when Megadaq queries the PS voltage, it sets it to constant voltage max.
relevant files - cooling_1, cooling_1_1.
time - 11:30 finished with bad files and started good measurements as said below
solution: not to query, use constant current.
current = 0.5 +- 0.0005 amp

1-cooling. looks fine. but negative resistance at the end. dont know why.
note: without external currnet at temp ~24ohm voltage on sample is (-4)-(-2)µV

TODO: take sample without current, just basic voltage on SC at all temperatures for thermoelectric potential reference

next: heating.
part-1 with heating resistor (1,then 5 then 10 V). part-2 heat res off, taken out of bath at ~125 sec, heat res back on at 200 sec at 5 V

ref!!

H external refernce
-----------------
at 1/2 to 2/3 radius off center


with magnetic field
-----------------------
0) cold. scan H, fast slow
1) heating slowly. scan H ___


termo couple
termo electric effect
limits of lab.


current coil = 5 amp
heating 20 volt .138 amp
at 270 secs start cooling again.
